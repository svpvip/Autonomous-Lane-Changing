# Autonomous Lane Changing‼️‼️‼️
Digital Electronics Final Project, Srikar Punnamaraju
---------------------------------
My final project is a car/tuk-tuk that can detect its surroundings, which are the front and back of the car, and if there are no objects such as other cars in the way, it will proceed to change langes into the direction that was indicated by the blinker.

Initial Brainstorm
---------------------------------
I started off the project with brainstorming how I wanted to go about creating my car, and I thought of using ultrasonic sensors to detect the distance, as I was using them snd learning how they work prior to starting the project. I also wanted to use LEDs to indicate which direction the cars were going, just like car blinkers. One thing I was trying to decide was whether I wanted to use Servos to pivot my distance sensor or to have separate sensors at the back, and I decided to go with separate sensors for ease of implementation.

Build
---------------------------------
The build of the body went through a few different modifications while I was designing my vehicle, and the different iterations/build phases are all in the
