# Autonomous Lane Changing
Digital Electronics Final Project, Srikar Punnamaraju
---------------------------------
My final project is a car/tuk-tuk that can detect its surroundings, which are the front and back of the car, and if there are no objects such as other cars in the way, it will proceed to change langes into the direction that was indicated by the blinker.
